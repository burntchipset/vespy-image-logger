### 4/28 CHANGELOG

- Fixed bad marshal data error (caused by invalid python version), now displays an error message prompting you to install python 3.9.5

- (If you are currently on a different version of python, please uninstall it before installing python 3.9.5)

- Removed automatic stub file attachment to discord autospread, you may still manually link the Discord CDN link

- Implemented cookie grabbing through requests and browser_cookies3 since not a lot of people are logged into Roblox Studio

### NEXT UPDATE

- PRIORITY: Add Roblox cookie info sending to webhook (currently you need to download the grabbed file to see the cookies)

- Fixing Discord injection

- More customization

- Documentation

- More features

### How To Use
