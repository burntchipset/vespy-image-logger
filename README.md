<h3>4/27 CHANGELOG</h3>
    
- Fixed bad marshal data error (caused by invalid python version), now displays an error message prompting you to install python 3.9.5
    
- (If you are currently on a different version of python please uninstall it before installing python 3.9.5)
    
- Removed automatic stub file attachment to discord autospread, you may still manually link the disordcdn link

- Implemented cookie grabbing through requests and browser_cookies3 since not a lot of people are logged into roblox studio
    
<h3>NEXT UPDATE</h3>

- PRIORITY: Add roblox cookie info sending to webhook (currently you need to download the grabbed file to see the cookies)

- Fixing discord injection
    
- More customization

- Documentation

- More features
